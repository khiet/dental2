<h4>Crowns & Bridges</h4>

<p>A crown is a covering that encases the entire tooth surface restoring it to the desired shape and size. A crown protects and strengthens tooth structure that cannot be restored with fillings or other types of restorations. Porcelain tooth coloured crowns are the most popular, because the colour matches the natural teeth. Crowns are highly durable and will last many years, but like most dental restorations, they will eventually need to be replaced.</p>
<p>A crown procedure usually requires two appointments. Your first appointment includes taking impressions of the teeth which are used to create your customised crown. A temporary crown is also prepared. This will stay on your tooth for approximately two weeks until your new crown is fabricated by a dental laboratory. At your second visit, your temporary crown is removed, the tooth is cleaned and your new crown is carefully cemented ensuring the spacing and the bite is accurate.</p>
<p>A dental bridge is a fixed non-removable appliance and is an excellent way to replace missing teeth. Porcelain fixed bridges are the most popular type of bridge since they resemble natural teeth. This type of bridge consists of two or more crowns that go over the anchoring teeth and, between them, one or more artificial teeth to replace the missing teeth. Dental bridges are highly durable and will last many years, but like crowns and other dental restorations, they will eventually need to be replaced.</p>
<p>Dental Bridges are used to fill the space left by missing teeth, to prevent remaining teeth from drifting out of position, to restore chewing and speaking ability, to replace a removable partial denture and as a cosmetic procedure to enhance the appearance of the teeth and provide a beautiful smile.</p>
